Coding exercises, handy practice for technical interview questions. I will put up my solutions to some popular questions and exercises in this repo, and welcome any feedback or suggestions!

All of the exercises are coded in my favorite language, Clojure.

Most of the exercises are taken from "Cracking the Coding Interview, 4th Edition, by Gayle Laakmann.
